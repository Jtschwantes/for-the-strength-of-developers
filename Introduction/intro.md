6.  Account Usage: 
    1.  MS Teams: Current platform for team communication. Use your student id to create an account.
        * Need to be on it if you're on the clock
        * Have Josh add you to "Tech Team" conversation.
        * Recommended to have MS Teams on your mobile device in case you need to be reached about code you wrote or need to be pushed
        * If you get a message from Josh asking you to complete something, assume it's the next time you're in the office unless it's an emergency
        * Can use MS Teams to reach Josh when he is out of the office - will do his best to respond
    1.  D2L: As our current Learning Management System (LMS), we write automation processes for and solve inconveniences caused by d2l (brightspace or I-Learn).
    2.  Canvas: The prospective future LMS for BYU-Idaho. We use API functions to communicate with their servers to test the conversion tool.
    4.  Github: Use this on a daily basis to keep track of projects, push, branch, and fork existing code.
    3.  Equella: The University's current Content Management System. Used rarely, but important to context of specific projects.
    6.  Kaltura: The University's current Video Platform. USed rarely, but important to context of specific projects.

    1.  The drawers next to Station F have office supplies
    1.  LAM 118 - Sister Tonks' office has refills for office supplies, just go to that office and tell her where you work and she will get you the supplies you need.

##  Getting Help
1.  Getting Help from coworkers/Josh
    * There's a lot to learn, so please ask questions no matter how often.
2.  How to learn from the Internet
    * We are asked to do a lot of things that we don't know how to do, and things that presumably no one at the University has been asked to do, therefore, we must be good at learning from the internet.
    1.  Copying code from the Internet
        1.  Copyright
        * We don't want to get the university in legal trouble.
            1.  Derivative work
                * If you take someone else's work and modify it, you're infringing on the copyright of the original owner.
            2.  Fair use
                * It's all a gray area
                * Under certain permissions, you are allowed to use someone else's work.
                * Teaching or using copies for educational purposes is not an infringement of copyright. In many cases we are teaching but since this office is on the business side of the University, the purpose could be for business purposes.
            3.  Nate Wise
            4.  Risk assessment
                * Spirit of the Law - trying to do the right thing the right way with the code as the license was written. 
                * Letter of the Law - following the law as it is written
            5.  Attribution
                * If necessary, give attribution where it is due. Read the license carefully and give attribution as pertained in the license.
                * If there is only one way to code something, then you don't have to attribute it every time you use it because it cannot be copyrighted. 
            6.  Distribute vs use
                * If you're downloading it and using it on your computer, then you're using it.
                * If you're putting it on the internet for other people to use and download, then you're distributing it. We don't distribute.
        2.  Open Source Licensing
            * 100% of what we do and use is open source.
            1.  vs free
            2.  Github and forking
                * No matter what license you're under, if you put it on Github, anyone can fork it or use it. 
                * That's why private users must pay.
        3.  What we make is [MIT](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)
