1.  Scheduling
    * Minimum of 15 hours/week

    * If it is absolutely necessary for you to go under 15 hours a week, talk to Josh as soon as possible and resolve any issues beforehand.
    * Try to sign up for the same computer, so you don't have to setup multiple computers to your personal preferences annd/or install things.
1.  No working at home
    * Standard: no working at home
        * Exceptions can be made, distinctions will need to be made between what is working and what is not working
    * Clock in and out a bunch of times honestly rather than doing anything dishonest
        * Being paid with tithing funds

6.  Account Usage: 
    1.  **MS Teams:** Current platform for team communication. Use your student id/student email to create an account.
        * Need to be on it if you're on the clock
        * Have Josh add you to "Tech Team" conversation.
        * Recommended to have MS Teams on your mobile device in case you need to be reached about code you wrote or need to be pushed
        * If you get a message from Josh asking you to complete something, assume it's the next time you're in the office unless it's an emergency
        * Can use MS Teams to reach Josh when he is out of the office - will do his best to respond
    1.  **D2L:** As our current Learning Management System (LMS), we write automation processes for and solve inconveniences caused by d2l (brightspace or I-Learn).
    2.  **Canvas:** The prospective future LMS for BYU-Idaho. We use API functions to communicate with their servers to test the conversion tool.
    4.  **Github:** Use this on a daily basis to keep track of projects, push, branch, and fork existing code.
    3.  **Equella:** The University's current Content Management System. Used rarely, but important to context of specific projects.
    6.  **Kaltura:** The University's current Video Platform. Used rarely, but important to context of specific projects.
8. Whiteboard policy
    * It's great to use the whiteboard to map and visualize the projects you're working on. However, the whiteboards can get pretty full of a bunch of random stuff from multiple people. 
    * If you need to use the whiteboard and it's full to the point that it needs to be erased, then ask around if anyone still needs that information and if it wasn't theirs to say, take a photo of it (sometimes could be both sides) and upload it to the "whiteboard" channel on MS Teams.

8.  How to get office supplies
    1.  The drawers next to Station F in our office have supplies for our team.
    1.  LAM 118 - Sister Tonks' office has refills for office supplies, just go to that office and tell her where you work and she will get you the supplies you need.
