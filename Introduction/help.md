# Intro - part II

##  Getting Help
1.  Getting Help from coworkers/Josh
    * There's a lot to learn, so please ask questions **no matter how often.**
2.  How to learn from the Internet
    * We are asked to do a lot of things that we don't know how to do, and things that presumably no one at the University has been asked to do, therefore, we must be good at learning from the internet.
    1.  Copying code from the Internet
        1.  Copyright
        * We don't want to get the university in legal trouble.
            1.  Derivative work
                * If you take someone else's work and modify it, you're infringing on the copyright of the original owner.
            2.  Fair use
                * It's all a gray area
                * Under certain permissions, you are allowed to use someone else's work.
                * Teaching or using copies for educational purposes is not an infringement of copyright. In many cases we are teaching but since this office is on the business side of the University, the purpose could be for business purposes.
            3.  Nate Wise
                * Digital Content & Intellectual Property Rights faculty member at BYU-Idaho. If you have any serious concerns, get in contact with him.
            4.  Risk assessment
                * Spirit of the Law - trying to do the right thing the right way with the code as the license was written. 
                * Letter of the Law - following the law as it is written
            5.  Attribution
                * If necessary, give attribution where it is due. Read the license carefully and give attribution as pertained in the license.
                * If there is only one way to code something, then you don't have to attribute it every time you use it because it cannot be copyrighted. 
            6.  Distribute vs use
                * If you're downloading it and using it on your computer, then you're using it.
                * If you're putting it on the internet for other people to use and download, then you're distributing it. We don't distribute.
        2.  Open Source Licensing
            * 100% of what we do and use is open source.
            1.  vs free
            2.  Github and forking
                * No matter what license you're under, if you put it on Github, anyone can fork it or use it. 
                * That's why private users must pay.
        3.  What we make is [MIT](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)
            * [See licenses](https://choosealicense.com/)
        4.  Stack Overflow, Css Tricks, W3, MDN
            1. Stack Overflow [license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/)
            2. CSS tricks [license](https://css-tricks.com/license/)
            2. W3schools [license](https://www.w3schools.com/about/about_copyright.asp)
            2. MDN [license](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/About#Copyrights_and_licenses)
    2.  MDN (learning from the internet cont.)
        * No attribution is required
        * Documentation is really clean. They always include a description of the function, a demo of it that you can run on the page, parameters and a return value.
        * The documentation also includes multiple examples of that function and when it was invented. 
        * It also includes [polyfills](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Polyfill), which we will learn about later. 
        * Gives all suggestions similar to each array function, which ones are deprecated and which functions are new. 
    3.  Browser Compatibility
        1.  Check [CanIuse.com](https://caniuse.com/) to check the compatibility with the features you're trying to use. 
        2. Our audience is really important, since we build things that end up all over the world, but we also build stuff only for people in this building.
    6.  Reading Documentation
        * Reading to find Solutions
            1. Clearly define your problem before you start your search
            3. You can very well find solutions to problems by reading to find solutions, but sometimes it doesn't mean you understand it.
            2. Make sure you understand why that solution works and what makes it different from your original solution.
            4. Can be effective - doesn't necessarily help you learn what you're doing or why it works, but does get the job done.
        * vs Reading for learning
            1. There's more value in you LEARNING the code than correctly passing a training exercise. 
            2. Read the documentation from top to bottom 
            3. Read the documentation more than once
            3. Take the time to do this if you're noticing that you use a certain library frequently
            4. Can be extremely effective through the design process - the true proof of concept 
    5.  Use a good library instead of writing your own
        1.  [Compare npm](https://npmcompare.com)
        2. No matter how good our code is, we're a small team. We're not going to beat the world if the world uses it.
        3. Professional work that you produce should be supported by professional work. 
        4. We've compiled a list of common libraries that we use that's a part of the core training
    7.  Stay updated with what's happening in JavaScript.
