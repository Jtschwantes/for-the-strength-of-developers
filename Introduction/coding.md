##  Git
1.  Learn it
    1.  [Learn Git](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)
2.  Committing Standards
    1.  Commit often
    2.  Push everyday
        * don't leave the office without pushing
        * if necessary, pull everyday.
    3.  If in the middle of something make a branch and commit and push
        * Branches - [Learn Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)
    4.  Pull before you push and before you code - especially if it is a group effort.

4.  Github
    1.  Pull requests
        * Requests to change the master branch
    2.  Forking
        * Copy the library
    3.  Uploading files
    4.  Make changes in browser
        * Make changes in the browser by clicking on the file, and then choosing the pencil icon on the top right of the file. 
        * It's not guaranteed that your code is valid when doing this so try to do this as rarely as possible (like if you're just commenting something out or adding some semicolons).
    5.  Issues
        1.  Bug
            * Add issues on the repository for things that aren't working properly.
        2.  Ideas for improvements
            * If you have ideas on how to improve code in byuitechops, make an issue.
5.  Markdown
    1.  [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

##  Basic Code Lessons
###  JavaScript
1.  Linting - eslint
2.  Designing - 3 legged stool
    1.  Working code
    2.  Readable code
    3.  Efficient code
    * This order is important. There is so much rollover in this job that the readability factor is far more important than how efficient it is. Maintaining our own code happens over a long time, so we need readable code.
3.  ES6
    1.  Talk to josh for now
    2.  history of jsâ€™s evolution
    1.  ECMAScript vs js
    3.  [Browser Compatibilities](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/)
    4.  [Node.green](http://node.green/)
4.  Array Methods
    1.  [Learn Markdown](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/byuitechops/Array-functions/blob/master/learn-arrays.markdown&sa=D&ust=1519691185403000&usg=AFQjCNGN6D7D45RxI15XvBCv_CpJowhCYQ)
    2.  Data structure manipulation
        1.  Convert CSV of cities
            1.  Headers: name, population, county, state
            2.  To array of state with name and counties which has name and cities that has name and population
2.  Chrome Dev Tools
    1.  Put the word `Debugger;` on a breaking point where you'd like to test your code. When chrome opens, your code will stop on that break point.
    2.  If you haven't learned `console.log` yet, all it does is print words onto the console you're using. Use `console.log` effectively to test your code.  
2.  Learnyounode lessons 1-3
    1.  The learnyounode exercises will direct you to outdated documentation. The new documentation on these functions can be found [here.](https://nodejs.org/api/synopsis.html)
    2. Get started by running the following in cmd
        ```  
        npm install -g learnyounode
        ```
    3. After you install, run `learnyounode`. The program will open and you can begin with exercise 1.
3.  Node Debugging - Chrome Dev Tools
    * To debug your program in the node debugger with Chrome, use 
        ```
        node --inspect-brk myProgram.js
        ``` 
###  NPM
1.  [Important videos](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm)
