# CSV Training

## Instructions
1. Download the following file [citiesTraining.js](citiesTraining.js) (Right click, then choose download.)
2. Open the file in VS Code.
2. Read through the file paying close attention to the information found in the comment blocks.
2. You will only be programming two functions, convertData() and sortData(). **Do not** change the code found at the top of the file, **and** the code found in the display() and main() functions.
2. Once you have programed both functions and are ready to begin testing, uncomment the display function inside of main(). 
2. In the terminal, type ‘node citiesTraining.js’ (Without the single quotes).
2. Once your output is the same as the [expected output](./correctOutput.md), call over Bro. Mckinney to check it out.
