# Training
Welcome to the team! We're excited to have you join our ranks! This training has been designed to help you learn and grow, no matter your experience level. A few things to note before getting started:

* PLEASE ASK QUESTIONS - We are all friendly (mostly) and have all been where you're at
* LEARN WELL - We'd rather you learn these things well and take your time, rather than have you rush through it and not understand it
