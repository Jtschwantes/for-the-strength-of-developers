# One-on-one's with Leads
These one-on-one's are principally for following up with each employee, making sure documentation and the GitHub board are up-to-date, and is also to act as a `catch-all` for any issues, concerns, or suggestions within/for the office.

## Interview Process
The following is the general process for conducting a one-on-one. 

First, start the interview with a prayer.

General Questions include: 
1. How are you/personal questions?
2. What did you work on this week/ what are your current projects?
3. Is your documentation up-to-date?
4. How productive do you feel you were this week?
5. How timely were you this week? How can we improve that?
6. How did you do w/ your goals?
7. What are your new goals?
8. Feedback from lead based on their responses

Next, ask other questions determined by leadership.

Then get onto the project board and make sure:
1. All projects are there
2. All projects are in the correct columns
3. All documentation is completed for each project
4. All documentation is up-to-date for each project

Afterwards, make plans on how to get through their roadblocks and concerns. 
If itâ€™s just talking to Josh, help them talk to him right after the meeting.

Now, ask them `"Do you have any suggestions for the leads, for Josh, or for the office?"`

TODO: Add a sentance or two saying that leads should always take suggestions to Josh even if they disagree.

## Addressing Concerns with an Employee
If you feel disciplinary action needs to be taken in regards to something outside of the general questions listed above, then:
1. Talk with Josh before addressing it with the employee 
2. Come up with a game plan with Josh on how to address the issue
3. **With Josh's approval**, talk to the employee about it following the aforementioned plan

## Final Words
**Regardless of whether or not the employee was given correction**, be sure to express appreciation to them for the work they are doing. Give them encouraging words and try to point out one or two things they've been doing particularly well. We're all making improvements, but this meeting should be an uplifting and encouraging one.
