# Lead Responsibilities
First and foremost, a leader should be a disciple of Jesus Christ. As you seek to lead as He leads, you will be blessed to know what to say, how to help, and how to teach those around you. 

## Weekly Responsibilities

### One-on-ones
Conduct one-on-one interviews with each member of the team weekly. Scheduling these interviews is up to the lead and the team members, so as to find the best times that work best for both the lead and the student employee. More information on how to conduct these interviews can be found in the [One-on-one](./one-on-ones.md) instructions page.

### Three P's
Every day when employees come into work, they are to message the leads and Josh their Progress, Plans, and Problems (Three P's) as found in the [Keep the Commandments](../2.%20Policies%20and%20Standards/Policies.md) page in the training.

It is also your job to help remind them to do their Three P's if they forget. This is easier to do if they are trained well when they join the team.

### Team Meetings
As a lead, you are in charge of the weekly team meetings that happen each Thursday at 2:00pm. Team meeting responsibilities include:

1. Making sure everyone on the team knows there is a meeting
1. Assigning team members to give the opening prayer, spiritual thought, and take minutes during the meeting to be put on the team `General Messaging Channel` after the meeting is over
1. Organize the announcements for the meeting
1. Know the schedule of the meeting before hand and assign out any responsibilites
1. Conduct the meeting
1. Have a coding challenge on hand in case there is time after all announcements and trainings are done

### Follow-up
We want everyone on the team to be a good steward of their time, documentation, and all of their work. This is something we need to consistently train on, seeing as no one is perfect. 

Until everyone reaches perfection, so Seth Childers is exempt from this, one of your main responsibilities is to follow-up on everything to make sure things get done. Things to follow-up on include but are not restricted to:

- **Josh and his to-do's** - some things are priority and he has a lot on his plate so you need to help remind him of time sensitive things
- **Readme's, Project Captures, Key Components, GitHub project board** - each of these needs to be kept up-to-date by each employee
- **Announcements from team meetings** - many of the announcements from the team meeting each week need follow-up to ensure team members are implementing the changes that are introduced to the office
- **Team member goals and assignments made in one-on-ones** - part of each one-on-one is making goals for the week. Be sure to follow-up on the goals they set and help them make improvements. You may want to take notes or ask them to write down their goals each week so follow-up is easier, as well as adding more accountability to help them accomplish their goals

## Other Responsibilities

### Hiring
Leads, as well as other employees upon request, are to help Josh with the hiring process. Here are some of the steps of this process:

1. Help Josh get the job openning on the [job board](https://web.byui.edu/studentemployment/) on the school website
1. Get the word out that we are hiring (Announce to the office that we are hiring to try to hire through referrals and notify our list of instructors we have networked with to announce to their students that we are hiring)
1. As applications come through, go through them and rate them on a scale of 1-4 and have Josh look through them after you have rated them. The scale is as follows:
    - 1 - Interview them
    - 2 - Potentially interview them
    - 3 - Hesitant about interviewing
    - 4 - Don't interview them
 1. Setup interviews using the [email templates](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1whhSRbO8UX7EEuUSg8_BjtCRmkyumSKV) and the Google Form found in the team Google Drive
 1. Talk to Josh about the interview process and what to look for in the interviews

### Schedule
There are two main parts to a lead's responsibilities regarding the schedule:

1. Help Josh create a seating chart each semester based on everyone's preferred schedule/hours.
1. Enforce the schedule and follow up with employees when they are not following the schedule. 

After creating the seating chart for the semester, work with the person in charge of the schedule to copy the created seating chart from the template into the remaining weeks of the semester on the schedule.

If employee's have consistent problems following their schedule, consider talking to them in their one-on-ones about updating the schedule to better match their available hours.
