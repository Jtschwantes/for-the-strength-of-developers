# How we Keep a Steady Upward Course
## Our System for Continual Improvement

1. The members of the project taskforce (leads, Josh and others) will meet weekly for at least 1 hour with the purpose of improving
the systems in the office. (This is called the project taskforce meeting). Topics may include:
  - Handbook Improvements
  - Training Improvements

2. Suggestions for office improvement can come in the one on one meetings that the leads have, or they can be given directly to Josh.
