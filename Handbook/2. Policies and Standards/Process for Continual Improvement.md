# How we Keep a Steady Upward Course
## Our System for Continual Improvement

1. Leads, Josh and other guests appropriate to the discussion will meet weekly for at least 1 hour with the purpose of improving
the systems in the office. Topics may include:
- Handbook Improvements
- Training Improvements

2. Suggestions for office improvement can come in the one on one meetings that the leads have, or they can be given directly to Josh.
