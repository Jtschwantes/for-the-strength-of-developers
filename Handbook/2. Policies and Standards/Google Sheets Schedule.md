# Laws of the Schedule
### What is the Google Sheets Schedule?
The purpose of the [schedule](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1SPDy1uasCfYwniestHpjnZOaFpYJV7uF0CRFK9zq-AA) is to inform your team members and Josh when you will be at work and what station you will be working on.

### What is it not?
The schedule is **NOT** WorkdayÂ®. Your merciful _Timelord_ ~~(not a Doctor Who reference),~~ does not keep track of how many hours you actually worked or when you were or weren't here. The schedule may not always reflect your actual hours.

## How to Use the Schedule
_Note: these rules do not override BYU-Idaho student employee rules, regulations, standards, etc._

1. At the beginning of your employment or when **prompted** put your approximate preferred weekly hours in the page entitled **Preferred Schedule**. This will help the Timelord roughly assign stations to increase productivity and decrease confusion.
2. Base Rules:
    - Follow the rule: **15 hours per week, at least 3 days per week, no less than 2 hours at a time.**
    - You may **not** work during Devotional on Tuesdays.
    - **International Students**: You may **not** work more than the BYU-Idaho standard for international student employees.
    - **Non-International Students**: You may **not** work more than **40 hours each week**.
    - **Devotional**: If you are a full-time employee you may stay clocked on during devotional if you attend during work hours. Ask Josh for more information on this.
    - You may **not** work Saturdays. Ask Josh if you have questions.
    - Changes can be made to **Preferred Schedule** at any time; so if you have _semester long changes to your desired hours_ during the semester (not weekly changes) you can make edits as needed and let the Timelord know so stations can be shifted for future weeks to help accommodate everyone.
3. You may make edits to the next week and the week following that. Sheets lock and unlock every **Friday at 5pm** so you must make any changes to the schedule _before_ then.
4. You may not edit the current week's schedule.
    - Let Josh and the leads know in slack if you won't be able to be here for scheduled hours. This is between you and them; your Timelord doesn't ~~care~~ need to know.
5. You may work _more_ hours than are on the schedule, but _only_ if a station is available on the schedule. Do not commit to working on a station if someone else is scheduled to use that station soon.
6. You have priority over a station you are scheduled to use. If someone else is using it _while you are scheduled to use it_ you have permission to politely ask to use your station. Be courteous and willing to use a different station if necessary. Work it out amongst yourselves; we are all adults. ~~Josh and your Timelord don't care where you sit.~~ Josh and the Timelord should not have to get involved.
7. If you forget to make a major schedule change before **Friday at 5pm** or something comes up, let Josh and the Timelord know ASAP. It can be fixed. Know that you may not get to use the station you'd like to if this happens.
8. You cannot request new colors (as of now). It isn't a Timelord thing; it's a Google-Scripts-is-annoying thing.
9. You may **not** work on [BYU-Idaho observed holidays](https://www.byui.edu/human-resources/total-rewards/holiday-schedule). Although they are **"Paid Holidays"**, you will **not** receive compensation as a part-time/student employee. Sorry.
10. Further questions about the schedule should be directed to the Timelord. Further questions regarding BYU-Idaho's student employment policies and standards can be found [here](https://www.byui.edu/human-resources/employment/student-employment).
