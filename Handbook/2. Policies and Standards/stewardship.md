# Stewardship

Welcome to the team.
## Who We Are
Regardless of your past, you are a professional developer now. Additionally, more important than being a professional in the business world at this office we act as the Savior would act. We can ask ourselves, what would the Savior do if He were a developer working in this office?

Many teams in the world take pride in what they do, and we are no exception. The work we do to maintain and automate BYU-I online and Pathway online affects people all around the world. What we do is not just coding, we are contributing to a mechanism that enables thousands of people in all kinds of circumstances to progress. Their education will cause a ripple effect that will be seen for generations to come. 

> "Those graduates of BYU-Idaho will become and this is a prophecy that I am prepared to make and make solemnly those graduates of BYU-Idaho will become legendary for their capacity to build the people around them and to add value wherever they serve" - Henry B Eyring [A Steady, Upward Course](http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2001_09_18_Eyring.htm).

We are not just building tools and applications. We are building 



> And then the Lord told Joseph that great knowledge was about to be revealed to the earth through the power of the Holy Ghost.  The scripture states: “God shall give unto you knowledge by his Holy Spirit . . . that has not been revealed since the world was until now” (D&C 121:26).  The Lord went on to say that it would be “A time to come in the which nothing shall be withheld, . . . All thrones and dominions, principalities and powers, shall be revealed . . . And also, if there be bounds set to the heavens or to the seas, or to the dry land, or to the sun, moon, or stars—All the times of their revolutions, all the appointed days, months, and years, . . . and all their glories, laws, and set times, shall be revealed in the days of the dispensation of the fulness of times” (D&C 121:28-31).

> The Lord makes clear that in the last days, the dispensation of the fulness of times, all things will be revealed.  (See D&C 101:23-34.)  All knowledge includes the laws that govern the earth as well as those which are spiritual in nature.  The Apostle Paul prophesied 1800 years earlier “That in the dispensation of the fulness of times” the Lord will “gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth” (Ephesians 1:10).

Moreover, the knowledge would not only pertain to the spiritual realm but also include knowledge pertaining to the earth (see D&C 121:25, 29-31).  From the time of Christ until 1820, Angus Maddison’s data supports the notion that the heavens were almost sealed during the dark ages.  Finally, a small stream of light began to emerge between 1500 and 1800.  And then Maddison says something happened.  The switch was turned on and a flood of knowledge pierced men’s minds beginning about 1820.

Brothers and sisters, you are living the miracle, the promise made by the Lord to His prophet 170 years ago.  It is interesting that the world is just beginning to understand what has happened, but still does not perceive the Source.  The technological inventions and discoveries of the last 170 years are a clear witness that our Father in Heaven and His Son deliver on Their promises.  They control the universe.  They know the pace and the extent of the discoveries needed for the gospel to reach every nation, kindred, tongue and people.

 

I testify to you that the gospel of Jesus Christ was restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith and that President Gordon B. Hinckley has all of the priesthood keys necessary to save and exalt you and me.  I testify that the Savior performed the Atonement so that our shortcomings will not limit us if we exercise faith in Him, repent, and partake of the ordinances and covenants associated with His work.  Finally, the Lord is the Source of all truth including the marvelous scientific discoveries and inventions that have improved mankind’s lot during the last 200 years.  May our testimonies of Him deepen and may we enjoy the power of His Holy Spirit in our lives is my prayer

## Media & Entertainment
Employees may listen to music while working on projects, but must use headphones to be respectful of those that sit around them. When working, they must have the normal office communications open at all times, in case a colleague either in this office or a different one needs to get ahold of them. Employees should choose music that would be uplifting and won’t drive away the spirit from this consecrated building. Netflix, YouTube, and movies are not permitted while working. In short:
- No social media (Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, etc.)
- Only use hands-free music (try not to be constantly switching songs or looking up music)

## Breaks
Be aware that breaks are meant to increase productivity. Please be a good judge of your productivity. The following is our policy for breaks:

- 15 minutes every 2 hours. 
- Must be taken outside of the office or in the war room, unless there is a meeting taking place there
- Only 3 people at a time, no distracting others

## Food
You are not to eat at your computer. If you need to eat, please clock out and go to the war room or elsewhere to eat. These computers are payed for with tithing funds, so please treat them with care.

Ethics and Integrity
As a member of the Quality Assurance LMS team, you will have high level access to I-Learn. Therefore, it is essential that you exemplify high moral integrity in order to be in good standings with the school, the law, and the church. Failure to uphold ethics will result in severe disciplinary action.
Integrity
“We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men; indeed, we may say that we follow the admonition of Paul—We believe all things, we hope all things, we have endured many things, and hope to be able to endure all things. If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things.”7
-Article of Faith 1:13
For the Strength of Youth has this to say about Honesty and Integrity:
“Be honest with yourself, others, and God at all times. Being honest means choosing not to lie, steal, cheat, or deceive in any way. When you are honest, you build strength of character that will allow you to be of great service to God and others. You will be blessed with peace of mind and self-respect. You will be trusted by the Lord and will be worthy to enter into His holy temples.
“Dishonesty harms you and harms others as well. If you lie, steal, shoplift, or cheat, you damage your spirit and your relationships with others. Being honest will enhance your future opportunities and your ability to be guided by the Holy Ghost. Be honest at school; choose not to cheat in any way. Be honest in your job, giving a full amount of work for your pay. Do not rationalize that being dishonest is acceptable, even though others may think it does not matter.
“Closely associated with honesty is integrity. Integrity means thinking and doing what is right at all times, no matter what the consequences. When you have integrity, you are willing to live by your standards and beliefs even when no one is watching. Choose to live so that your thoughts and behavior are always in harmony with the gospel.”1
Honor Code
As a Church school, we expect all student employees to adhere to the honor code at all times.
Academic Honesty
"We agree to be completely honest in all our dealings, including class assignments and tests. This means we don't plagiarize material, fabricate or falsify information, or cheat."2
As a student employee in Quality Assurance, you have access to all I-Learn courses. You are expected to never access classes that you will have to take yourself, or classes you may have to take. You are also to never alter any grade, whether your own or someone else's. This is a violation of federal law, and you will serve jail time if you do so.
Student Life
"The divide between the standards of the gospel and those of the world continues to widen. There is safety in abiding by gospel standards. We agree to abstain from behavior that conflicts with the CES Honor Code, like immorality, pornography, violent or sexually explicit entertainment or gambling. We also avoid situations which might compromise our standards and tempt us unnecessarily."3
Computer crime and copyright infringement are included in this section. Never copy information from the courses for any use outside of fulfilling your job duties.
"All forms of harassment (verbal, physical, mental or sexual), hazing, intimidation, exploitation, or aggressive behavior that threaten or endanger the physical or emotional health and safety of others is in violation of the Honor Code."3
The environment of our workplace is determined by our behavior. All behavior in the workplace should be professional and keeping to the standards of the church.


Counsel from the Lord
"[I]t is with great alarm that we read newspaper accounts and hear daily media reports that describe the decline of moral decency and the erosion of basic ethical conduct. They detail the corrupting influence of dishonesty, from small-time, childish stealing or cheating to major embezzlement, fraud, and misappropriation of money or goods... The time is now to rededicate our lives to eternal ideals and values, to make those changes that we may need to make in our own lives and conduct to conform to the Savior’s teachings."5
-Elder David B. Haight  Of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles
"We cannot cope with the confusions and the challenges of this world unless we use a clear and consistent moral compass that will unerringly take us through our own personal trials and the tugs and pulls of our own temptations—a compass that will chart our way to peace of mind, self-worth, and joy.
"This moral compass is built around four absolute truths. The first absolute truth is that there is a loving Father in Heaven, and His Son, Jesus Christ, is our personal Savior—a more certain truth than any worldly fact... The second absolute truth is that there is an adversary, Satan, the tempter, who would lead us away from God and His infinite peace... The third absolute truth is that all of us choose our own course, endowed by agency... The fourth absolute truth is that the temptations of the devil can always be overcome by renewed faith in God and by repentance."6
