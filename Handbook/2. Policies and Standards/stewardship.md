# Stewardship

## Who We Are and Who We Serve
Regardless of your past, you are a professional developer now. Additionally, more important than being a professional in the business world at this office we act as the Savior would act. We can ask ourselves, what would the Savior do if He were a developer working in this office?

Many teams in the world take pride in what they do, and we are no exception. The work we do to maintain and automate BYU-I online and Pathway online affects people all around the world. What we do is not just coding, we are contributing to a mechanism that enables thousands of people in all kinds of circumstances to progress. Their education will cause a ripple effect that will be seen for generations to come. 

> "Those graduates of BYU-Idaho will become and this is a prophecy that I am prepared to make and make solemnly those graduates of BYU-Idaho will become legendary for their capacity to build the people around them and to add value wherever they serve" - Henry B Eyring [A Steady, Upward Course](http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2001_09_18_Eyring.htm).

Elder Bateman teaches that advances in technology happened at the same time that the restoration happened.

>Finally, a small stream of light began to emerge between 1500 and 1800.  And then Maddison says something happened.  The switch was turned on and a flood of knowledge pierced men’s minds beginning about 1820.
> Brothers and sisters, you are living the miracle, the promise made by the Lord to His prophet 170 years ago.  It is interesting that the world is just beginning to understand what has happened, but still does not perceive the Source.  The technological inventions and discoveries of the last 170 years are a clear witness that our Father in Heaven and His Son deliver on Their promises.  They control the universe.  They know the pace and the extent of the discoveries needed for the gospel to reach every nation, kindred, tongue and people. - Elder Merrill J. Bateman [Nothing Shall Be Withheld](http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2007_05_22_Bateman.htm).

Indeed, in so many areas technological advances have enabled the restoration's furtherment. We assist in building some of the mechanisms that continue the restoration.

We need to think about each one of Heavenly Father's children. We should think about the single mom who is going back to school to get her degree through pathway. We need to think about the boy across the ocean who starts with nothing, but is able to build something through pathway and byui online. We need to think about the family struggling financially that is able to send their child to school at byui because the subsidised costs.

With this vision in mind, let us know that we are not only professional developers, but we are developers who are changing the world now and will continue to do so in the future.

## Who Pays Us

BYU-Idaho pays us, but keep in mind the principle of the widows mite. Much of the funds from which our pay is pulled are tithing dollars. Our time and effort is payed for in part by tithing. Our time and efforts are sacred. Please keep this in mind as you determine what you should do with your time.

## Considerations

With the understanding of who we are and who we serve, remember when you are at work you are not on your own time, but you are on the school's time and involved in a great work. There are many distractions that can pull you away from your purpose. When distractions come, have the attitude that Nehemiah had:

>And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you? - Nehemiah 6:3

Here are some things that can be distractions:

- Music (Be concious of how listening to music affects your productivity and the productivity of those around you. If you have to constantly change the song (for example on YouTube), then you are constantly being distracted. Also be concious of the spirit that the music you listen to brings.)
- Food (eating can negatively affect your productivity)
- Movies (unless permission is granted, watching movies for entertainment is not something we do as it detracts from our purpose.)
- Phone/Social Media (Remember whose time you are on. You generally should not answer personal calls/texts/messages while on the clock.)

## Ethics and Integrity

Finally, a note on honesty and integrity. As a member of our team, you will have high level access to I-Learn. Therefore, it is essential that you exemplify high moral integrity in order to be in good standings with the school, the law, and the church. Failure to uphold ethics will result in severe disciplinary action.

For the Strength of Youth has this to say about Honesty and Integrity:
>“Be honest with yourself, others, and God at all times. Being honest means choosing not to lie, steal, cheat, or deceive in any way. When you are honest, you build strength of character that will allow you to be of great service to God and others. You will be blessed with peace of mind and self-respect. You will be trusted by the Lord and will be worthy to enter into His holy temples.
>“Dishonesty harms you and harms others as well. If you lie, steal, shoplift, or cheat, you damage your spirit and your relationships with others. Being honest will enhance your future opportunities and your ability to be guided by the Holy Ghost. Be honest at school; choose not to cheat in any way. Be honest in your job, giving a full amount of work for your pay. Do not rationalize that being dishonest is acceptable, even though others may think it does not matter.
>“Closely associated with honesty is integrity. Integrity means thinking and doing what is right at all times, no matter what the consequences. When you have integrity, you are willing to live by your standards and beliefs even when no one is watching. Choose to live so that your thoughts and behavior are always in harmony with the gospel.” - [Honesty and Integrity](https://www.lds.org/youth/for-the-strength-of-youth/honesty-and-integrity?lang=eng)

### Honor Code
As a Church school, we expect all student employees to adhere to the honor code at all times.

### Academic Honesty
> "We agree to be completely honest in all our dealings, including class assignments and tests. This means we don't plagiarize material, fabricate or falsify information, or cheat."

As a student developer on our team, you have access to all I-Learn courses. You are expected to never access classes that you will have to take yourself, or classes you may have to take. You are also to never alter any grade, whether your own or someone else's. This is a violation of federal law, and you will serve jail time if you do so.

### Student Life

> "The divide between the standards of the gospel and those of the world continues to widen. There is safety in abiding by gospel standards. We agree to abstain from behavior that conflicts with the CES Honor Code, like immorality, pornography, violent or sexually explicit entertainment or gambling. We also avoid situations which might compromise our standards and tempt us unnecessarily."

Computer crime and copyright infringement are included in this section. Never copy information from the courses for any use outside of fulfilling your job duties.

> "All forms of harassment (verbal, physical, mental or sexual), hazing, intimidation, exploitation, or aggressive behavior that threaten or endanger the physical or emotional health and safety of others is in violation of the Honor Code."

The environment of our workplace is determined by our behavior. All behavior in the workplace should be professional and keeping to the standards of the church.
