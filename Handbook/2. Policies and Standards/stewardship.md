Ethics and Integrity
As a member of the Quality Assurance LMS team, you will have high level access to I-Learn. Therefore, it is essential that you exemplify high moral integrity in order to be in good standings with the school, the law, and the church. Failure to uphold ethics will result in severe disciplinary action.
Integrity
“We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men; indeed, we may say that we follow the admonition of Paul—We believe all things, we hope all things, we have endured many things, and hope to be able to endure all things. If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things.”7
-Article of Faith 1:13
For the Strength of Youth has this to say about Honesty and Integrity:
“Be honest with yourself, others, and God at all times. Being honest means choosing not to lie, steal, cheat, or deceive in any way. When you are honest, you build strength of character that will allow you to be of great service to God and others. You will be blessed with peace of mind and self-respect. You will be trusted by the Lord and will be worthy to enter into His holy temples.
“Dishonesty harms you and harms others as well. If you lie, steal, shoplift, or cheat, you damage your spirit and your relationships with others. Being honest will enhance your future opportunities and your ability to be guided by the Holy Ghost. Be honest at school; choose not to cheat in any way. Be honest in your job, giving a full amount of work for your pay. Do not rationalize that being dishonest is acceptable, even though others may think it does not matter.
“Closely associated with honesty is integrity. Integrity means thinking and doing what is right at all times, no matter what the consequences. When you have integrity, you are willing to live by your standards and beliefs even when no one is watching. Choose to live so that your thoughts and behavior are always in harmony with the gospel.”1
Honor Code
As a Church school, we expect all student employees to adhere to the honor code at all times.
Academic Honesty
"We agree to be completely honest in all our dealings, including class assignments and tests. This means we don't plagiarize material, fabricate or falsify information, or cheat."2
As a student employee in Quality Assurance, you have access to all I-Learn courses. You are expected to never access classes that you will have to take yourself, or classes you may have to take. You are also to never alter any grade, whether your own or someone else's. This is a violation of federal law, and you will serve jail time if you do so.
Student Life
"The divide between the standards of the gospel and those of the world continues to widen. There is safety in abiding by gospel standards. We agree to abstain from behavior that conflicts with the CES Honor Code, like immorality, pornography, violent or sexually explicit entertainment or gambling. We also avoid situations which might compromise our standards and tempt us unnecessarily."3
Computer crime and copyright infringement are included in this section. Never copy information from the courses for any use outside of fulfilling your job duties.
"All forms of harassment (verbal, physical, mental or sexual), hazing, intimidation, exploitation, or aggressive behavior that threaten or endanger the physical or emotional health and safety of others is in violation of the Honor Code."3
The environment of our workplace is determined by our behavior. All behavior in the workplace should be professional and keeping to the standards of the church.


Counsel from the Lord
"[I]t is with great alarm that we read newspaper accounts and hear daily media reports that describe the decline of moral decency and the erosion of basic ethical conduct. They detail the corrupting influence of dishonesty, from small-time, childish stealing or cheating to major embezzlement, fraud, and misappropriation of money or goods... The time is now to rededicate our lives to eternal ideals and values, to make those changes that we may need to make in our own lives and conduct to conform to the Savior’s teachings."5
-Elder David B. Haight  Of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles
"We cannot cope with the confusions and the challenges of this world unless we use a clear and consistent moral compass that will unerringly take us through our own personal trials and the tugs and pulls of our own temptations—a compass that will chart our way to peace of mind, self-worth, and joy.
"This moral compass is built around four absolute truths. The first absolute truth is that there is a loving Father in Heaven, and His Son, Jesus Christ, is our personal Savior—a more certain truth than any worldly fact... The second absolute truth is that there is an adversary, Satan, the tempter, who would lead us away from God and His infinite peace... The third absolute truth is that all of us choose our own course, endowed by agency... The fourth absolute truth is that the temptations of the devil can always be overcome by renewed faith in God and by repentance."6
