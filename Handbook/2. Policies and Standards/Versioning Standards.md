# Versioning Standards

### Talked with Seth 3.0, but we don't have versioning standards yet.  Not sure what we want them to be, but we could have something like this:

(We would be essentially following npm's versioning standards)

1. Update patch when fixing a bug.
1. Update minor when adding something backwards compatible.
1. Update major when adding a feature that is not backwards compatible.

Do we need this document then?  Or should we just say somewhere else that we are going to follow npm standards?
