# Working with Stakeholders
## Communication
First and foremost, when the stakeholder makes a project request, a [Project Capture](https://github.com/byuitechops/for-the-strength-of-developers/blob/master/Handbook/6.%20Templates/01_ProjectCaptureDoc.md) document should be filled out. At the bottom of each Project Capture document there is a section titled `Best Mode of Contact`. What is written in this section should be the primary mode used to contact the given stakeholder.

If the designated mode of contact proves ineffective, follow these steps:

1. Email them
1. Call them using the phone in the war room. Find their information using the [BYUI Employee Directory](https://web.byui.edu/directory/employees/)
1. Visit them in their office during their office hours. Feel free to bring someone from the team or Josh with you as you deem appropriate. You can also find their office hours in the [BYUI Employee Directory](https://web.byui.edu/directory/employees/)

You may desire to skip straight to calling them or visiting them, depending on the urgency of the issue. 

## Emails
You must CC Josh on every email sent to stakeholders. This is so he can stay in the loop and help where needed. If you do not hear back from them within two days, you may follow-up with another email. Calling them or going to their office may prove to be more effective, and you may call them at any time within office hours.

## Professionalism and Dress
As employees of the school, it is important that you act professionally. Always greet them cordially and thank them for their time and help. 

When meeting with a stakeholder in person, you must dress business casual. This means:

**Men** - collared shirt and no denim    
**Women** - blouse, sweater, cardigan, dress, etc. and no denim. 

Beyond that, employees are expected to use common sense regarding this policy and follow the honor code.
