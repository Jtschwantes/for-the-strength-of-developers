# Working with Stakeholders
## Communication
First and foremost, when the stakeholder makes a project request, a [Project Capture](https://github.com/byuitechops/for-the-strength-of-developers/blob/master/Handbook/6.%20Templates/01_ProjectCaptureDoc.md) document should be filled out. At the bottom of each Project Capture document there is a section titled **Best Mode of Contact**. What is written in this section should be the primary mode used to contact the given stakeholder.

If the designated mode of contact proves ineffective, follow these steps:

1. Email them
1. Call them using the phone in the war room. Find their information using the [BYUI Employee Directory](https://web.byui.edu/directory/employees/)
1. Visit them in their office during their office hours. You can also find their office hours in the [BYUI Employee Directory](https://web.byui.edu/directory/employees/)

You may desire to skip straight to calling them or visiting them, depending on the urgency of the issue. 

## Professionalism and Dress
As employees of the school, it is important that you act professionally. Always greet them cordially and thank them for their time and help. 

When meeting with a stakeholder in person, you must dress business casual. This means:

**Men** - collared shirt and no denim    
**Women** - blouse, sweater, cardigan, dress, etc. and no denim. 

Beyond that, employees are expected to use common sense regarding this policy and follow the honor code.
