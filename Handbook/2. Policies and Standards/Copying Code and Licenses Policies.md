2.  Fair use
    * It's all a gray area
    * Under certain permissions, you are allowed to use someone else's work.
    * Teaching or using copies for educational purposes is not an infringementofcopyright.In many cases we are teaching but since this office is on thebusinessside of theUniversity, the purpose could be for business purposes.
