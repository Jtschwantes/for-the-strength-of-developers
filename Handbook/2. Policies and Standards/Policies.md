# General Policies and Standards

## Schedule
### Fifteen Hours

* You are expected to work AT LEAST 15 hours each week. These 15 hours need to be on the schedule for Josh and team members to refer to. 

* If you desire to work more than 15 hours in a week, please schedule the hours you guarantee that you will be in the office. You may work additional hours that are not scheduled upon approval, but will be held accountable for everything you put on the team schedule.

* You may modify your next-week's schedule up-to the day before the week starts (Sunday). If you need to modify it once the week has started, let leadership know and they will work with you on an individual basis.

### At Least Three Days
* You must be scheduled to work at least three days each week. This way progress can be made on projects, preventing you from becoming a roadblock in terms of progress and communication.

* Special circumstances may be worked out with leadership on an individual basis.

### Two hours at a Time
* You must work for at least two hours each time you come into work. This is to ensure enough time to make progress on projects and keeps you productive.

* If you are coming in for a meeting only, then this rule does not apply. 

* Special circumstances may be worked out with leadership on an individual basis.

### Late or Unable to Come In
* If you are going to be more than 5 min late or you are unable to come in due to sickness or an emergency, it is your responsibility to be in comminucation with the leads and Josh.

* Failure to do so may result in disciplinary action.

## Three P's
When arriving at work, the first thing you should do is send a group message to the leads and Josh with the following **Three P's**:

### Progress
* Briefly explain what progress you made the last time you were in the office. This could include emails sent, projects worked on, updates made to code, etc. While this is to be brief, please be specific so the leads and Josh can see the progress you are making.

### Plans
* Describe your plans for the day. This can be meetings you will be part of, emails you will send, projects you will be working on, etc. As before, please keep this brief but specific.

### Problems
* This is your opportunity to ask for help and communicate your roadblocks. These could include: you need to talk to Josh for approval, you are waiting to hear back from an stakeholder, you are having trouble with a specific library or function, etc.

## Working at home
* Standard: NO WORKING AT HOME
    * Exceptions can be made, distinctions will need to be made between what is workingand what is not working
* Clock in and out a bunch of times honestly rather than doing anything dishonest
    * Being paid with tithing funds  

## Heating and AC
* In our room (LAM 111):
    * on the east wall choose AC/Heat, and then move the degrees up or down. There is a min/max on them but you're allowed to do it as often as you like

## Whiteboard policy
* It's great to use the whiteboard to map and visualize the projects you're working on. However, the whiteboards can get pretty full of a bunch of random stuff from multiple people. 
* If you need to use the whiteboard and it's full to the point that it needs to be erased, then ask around if anyone still needs that information and if it wasn't theirs to say, take a photo of it (sometimes could be both sides) and upload it to the "dev-whiteboard-pics" channel on Slack.

<!-- 8.  How to get office supplies
    1.  The drawers next to Station F in our office have supplies for our team.
    1.  LAM 118 - Sister Tonks' office has refills for office supplies, just go to that office and tell her where you work and she will get you the supplies you need. -->
