## Platforms we work with
## Account Usage: 
* **Slack:** Current platform for team communication. Use your student id/student email to create an account.
    * Need to be on it if you're on the clock
    * Have Josh add you to "Tech Team" conversation.
    * Recommended to have Slack on your mobile device in case you need to be reached about code you wrote or need to be pushed
    * If you get a message from Josh asking you to complete something, assume it's the next time you're in the office unless it's an emergency
    * Can use Slack to reach Josh when he is out of the office - will do his best to respond
    
* **D2L:** The current Learning Management System (LMS) that we are transitioning out of, we write automation processes for and solve inconveniences caused by d2l (brightspace or I-Learn).
* **Canvas:** The new LMS for BYU-Idaho. We use API functions to communicate with their servers to automate processes and solve problems across courses.
* **GitHub:** Use this on a daily basis to keep track of projects, push, branch, and fork existing code.
* **Google Drive:** Where we store our HR stuff, as well as special reports and documentation (most of this is stored in GitHub, so only put things in here when asked to).
* **Equella:** The University's current Content Management System. Used rarely, but important to context of specific projects.
* **Kaltura:** The University's current Video Platform. Used rarely, but important to context of specific projects.
