# Preliminary Design

## Magic Box Chart

![alt text](linkToImage)

<!-- Think through the process as much as makes sense, and then create a magic box chart with the whiteboard and place it here. -->

## Explanation of Design
<!-- Add explanation of the Magic Boxes image above. Answers to the prompts below may also be appropriate to include here.

You may use whatever means will best explain your design. Below a template idea is provided that you can follow. You may find it useful to add additional details, however. -->

<!-- ### MyMeepFunction (VarA, VarB)
> `VarA`: What VarA should be or look like.

> `VarB`: What VarB should be or look like.

> `Returns`: What the function output is or looks like.

> `Description`: This function does this by doing this. -->

## Used Libraries
<!-- 
D3-DSV
Inquirer
Chalk
 -->

## Things to Consider Before Getting Project Approved
<!-- You don't need to write answers to these, just think through them while designing your preliminary design, and full design as needed. -->
- Are there any approved libraries that I can use? [Link to Approved Library List]
- Are there design patterns that will help?  [Link to Design Patterns]
- Can I design it so that it is a general tool instead of a specific solution?
- How can it be easily expanded?
- What does the minimum viable product look like?

## Prep for Learning Phase
<!-- You don't need to write answers to these, but be able to answer these questions when your preliminary Design is Complete. -->
- What do I need to learn
- How will I learn it
- What will I do to learn it (prototypes/tutorials/research time limit?)
- What is the definition of done for my learning process
- How do I measure the progress of learning
- Is there a deliverable that can be created during the learning process?

## Component Diagrams
<!-- Diagrams and companion explanations for all Key Components.
These would include information about inputs, outputs, and what a function does for every major function. -->

<!-- For each component, the following template will be followed: (In other words, the template below will repeat for each component)-->

### *Insert Component name here*

## Test Plans
For each major function the test plan template will be as follows (in other words the template below will repeat for each test) 
### *Insert name of component here (e.g. convertIdToCourseObject function)*
#### Test 1: *Insert Test name here*
Summary: 
 *Insert Test Summary Here*
 Type: *Insert Type here (Unit Test, Manual Test, Selenium/Puppeteer test (Overkill?))* 
Procedure:

<!-- Diagram Types:
 - Data Flow (I think this will be the most popular)
 - Structure Charts (This is really good for showing input and output of every function)
 - UML Class Diagram (a must for object oriented projects) -->
