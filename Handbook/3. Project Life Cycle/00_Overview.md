# Overview

## Project Capture
1. A student is assigned to a project
1. Student meets with stakeholder or Josh to get project requirements
1. Student fills out Project Capture Doc
1. Lead approves Project Capture Doc

## Preliminary Design
1. Student creates Magic Box Chart
1. Student creates list of libraries that will be used
1. Student runs through the checklist of questions, preping for the review meeting
1. Student meets with Josh/leads to discuss the design

## Learning
1. Student follows the learning plan created with Josh/leads

## Finalize Requirements
1. Student updates project capture doc as necessary.
1. If needed, student meets with the stakeholder to discuss changes to the requirements.

## Full Design
1. For each component that needs additional explanation, student creates a component chart with explanation, and adds to the Key Components Doc.
1. For each major module/function student adds how to test that module/function to the Key Componenets Doc.

## Development
1. Develop and test the tool/application

<!-- This may be updated later -->

## Stakeholder Handoff
1. Give the tool to the stakeholder
1. In rare cases where it is necessary, additional training material will be given to the stakeholder, so they know how to use the tool/application.

## Closing
1. Make sure your documentation is complete.
1. Update the github project board.
