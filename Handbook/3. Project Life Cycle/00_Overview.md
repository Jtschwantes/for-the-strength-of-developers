# Overview

## Project Capture
1. Student is assigned to project
1. Student meets with stakeholder or Josh to get project requirements
1. Student fills out Project Capture Doc
1. Lead approves Project Capture Doc

## Preliminary Design
1. Student creates Magic Box Chart
1. Create list of libraries that will be used
1. Run through the checklist of questions
1. Meet with Josh/leads to discuss your design

## Learning
1. Follow the learning plan you created with Josh/leads

## Finalize Requirements
1. Update project capture doc as necessary.
1. If needed meet with the stakeholder to discuss changes to the requirements.

## Full Design

## Understand The Problem + How to Solve ((*Design*))
while (!approved) {
^ Produce the Key Components Doc \
^^ Learning Proposal for things that are needed to learn, time expectations (not an artifact) \
^^^ GetApproval (You, Josh, KeyComponentsDoc, LearningProposal) \
}

## Learning Phase ((*Code*))
while  ( (!Learned && !TimesUp) || !DeliverableCreated) { \
   Learned = LearnFromPeer(Employee, Topic); \
   Learned L= LearnFromInternet(); \
   Learned = LearnFromMakingPrototypes(); \
   DeliverableCreated = MakeDeliverable(); \
   Learned = LearnFromJosh(); \
}
