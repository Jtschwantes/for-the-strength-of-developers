# 07 Stakeholder Handoff

## Purpose and Overview

The purpose of the stakeholder handoff is to place the tool in the hands of the stakeholder in such a way, so that their questions are answered and a tutorial is in place, so that anyone can be trained to use the tool by following the tutorial.

### Time Estimate: 1-3 hours
- *Depending on the project and knowledge of the developer, the time estimate may differ.*


## Tutorial of Process

1. Determine who or what team will own the application/tool going forward.
1. Create a tutorial style document (perhaps the README) that can be easily understood by the non-tech person that explains how to use the application/tool you developed. Include all details (for example if it is a CLI include all flags and options in this tutorial).
1. Train that team/stakeholder on how to use the tool/application and pass on the tutorial document that you just created, so that knowledge can be transferred from person to person going forward. Keep a copy of that tutorial document in the project repository for future reference.
