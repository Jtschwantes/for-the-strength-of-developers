# 03 Learning

## Purpose and Overview

The purpose of the learning phase is to answer the following questions:

1. Can it be done? (Is this possible?)
1. Can YOU do it? (Do you have the skills you need?)
1. Should we do it? (Is the ROI worth it?)
1. What will the timeline be?
1. How will we break up this project into deliverables? (What will the completion cycle be?)

### Deliverables
The deliverable from this phase is determined and defined in your meeting with Josh/Leads when getting your preliminary design approved.

### Time Estimate: Set Per Project
- *Depending on the project and knowledge of the developer, the time estimate may differ.*

## Tutorial of Process

This phase is very simple. Follow your instructions which you received from your meeting with Josh/Leads when getting the preliminary design portion of your Key Components Doc approved. When your prototypes/research/tutorials are completed, you are ready to review and complete your requirements and design.

Ways to learn:
- From Josh, from peers, from Pluralsight, from prototype.
