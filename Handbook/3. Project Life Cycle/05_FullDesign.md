# 05 Full Design

> Without requirements or design, programming is the art of adding bugs to an empty text file. - Louis Srygley

## Purpose and Overview

### Time Estimate: 1-3 hours
- *Depending on the project and knowledge of the developer, the time estimate may differ.*

Developers should anticipate that their design will change after conversations with more senior developers. They should approach the approval process with a "How can my design be better?" attitude.

## Tutorial of Process

1. Add Component Charts with Explanations\
  For each major component of your project that needs additional explanation, create an entry in the Component Diagrams section of the  Key Components Doc.
  Here are some of the different types of charts that you can create:
    - [Structure Chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_chart)
    - [Sequence Diagram](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/unified-modeling-language-uml-sequence-diagrams/)
    - [Class Diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_diagram)
    - [Data Flow Diagram](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/data-flow-diagram?a=0)
    - Other Diagram (perhaps a hybrid of some of the above that gets the design across and can be completely understood by another programmer without a verbal explanation)
  For many projects, chances are you will only need one chart. You may find it useful on other projects to include 2 or 3 charts to chart the design. Keep in mind that at this stage the chart(s) should only include what is necessary. That being said, make sure not to leave anything out that would be an essential part of the design! (Or to use a project management term, this design should be [lean](https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/manufacturing-design/5-lean-principles-every-should-know).)

1. Add How you will Test different Components

  As appropriate indicate in the key components document how you will test various components.
  
1. Set up a meeting with Josh/Leads to review your full design
