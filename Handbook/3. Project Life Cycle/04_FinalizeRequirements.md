## Tutorial of Process

0.  The Design Chart

Using either a whiteboard or an online design tool, create a design chart that fits your project, and include the link to the picture of the chart *in the key components doc*.

This is probably the most important part of the Key Components Doc and the entire Preliminary Design stage.

Here are some of the different types of charts that you can create:

- [Structure Chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_chart)
- [Sequence Diagram](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/unified-modeling-language-uml-sequence-diagrams/)
- [Class Diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_diagram)
- [Data Flow Diagram](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/data-flow-diagram?a=0)
- Other Diagram (perhaps a hybrid of some of the above that gets the design across and can be completely understood by another programmer without a verbal explanation)

For many projects, chances are you will only need one chart. You may find it useful on other projects to include 2 or 3 charts to chart the design. Keep in mind that at this stage the chart(s) should only include what is necessary. That being said, make sure not to leave anything out that would be an essential part of the design! (Or to use a project management term, this design should be [lean](https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/manufacturing-design/5-lean-principles-every-should-know).)
