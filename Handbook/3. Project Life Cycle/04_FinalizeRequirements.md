# 04 Finalize Requirements

## Purpose and Overview

### Deliverables
1. Updated Project Capture Doc

### Time Estimate: Not determined yet
- *Depending on the project and knowledge of the developer, the time estimate may differ.*

## Tutorial of Process

This process is simple. Look again at the project capture doc, and answer the following questions:

- Do the requirements listed there all make sense after you have gone through the preliminary design and the learning processes?
- Should requirements be added which make the tool more modular (able to be used in other contexts in the future)?
- Do I need to meet with the stakeholders to discuss changes?

Make adjustments to the requirements only as needed, and be sure to notify stakeholders of any changes that will affect them (if the changes to the requirements expand the requirements, and the end result will be the original plan plus more, you do not need to notify the stakeholder).

When you finish this stage, have the requirements reviewed by a lead.
